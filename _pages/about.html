<h1>About me</h1>
---
I'm a PhD student in computer science. I use deep learning models to analyze bio-medical data and old documents.

<h1>Research topics</h1>
---
<h2>Deep learning for bio-medical data:</h2>
- **M.Sc internship at Curie Institute "DAHAN team" and Pasteur Institute "Decision and Bayesian Computation" team - Automatic processing of microscopy and biomedical imaging data:** Classification and denoising of images with convolutional neural networks and U-Net based networks, and integration of trained models in Unity engine for future integration in virtual reality tool
- **Ph.D thesis - Analysis of neuro-degenerative diseases using deep learning:** Conception and implementation of multimodal architectures for cognitive decline prognosis based on data from multiple medical visits

<h2>Deep learning for cultural heritage:</h2>
**Automatic assembly of fragmented ancient documents:** Conception and implementation of siamese neural networks for pairwise fragment matching, and use of graph-based approaches for complete assembly proposal
